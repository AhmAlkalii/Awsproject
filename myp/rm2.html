                DC Comics, the company behind the DC Universe, was founded in 1934 by Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson.
                <br> The first DC comic book, "New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine," was published in 1935 and introduced a new concept to the comic book world: 
                <br>the comic book as a compilation of shorter stories.

                In 1938, DC Comics published "Action Comics #1," which introduced Superman to the world. 
                <br>This was a game-changer for the comic book industry and set the stage for the creation of many more iconic characters like Batman, 
                <br>Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, and Aquaman.

                Over the years, DC Comics has expanded its universe and brought countless stories to life through comic books, 
                <br>movies, TV shows, and video games. With its rich history and diverse cast of characters, 
                <br>the DC Universe continues to captivate audiences and inspire new generations of fans.
